I'm ready to:\n1. Understand the current architecture\n2. Find existing patterns and conventions\n3. Design a comprehensive implementation strategy\n4. Identify critical files and dependencies\n\nPlease share the requirements you'd like me to work on!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2340,"output_tokens":236,"cache_read_input_tokens":7680,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0}}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"39b690e2-577e-4bf9-9a36-54608cbc994b","timestamp":"2026-01-11T12:32:18.445Z"}
